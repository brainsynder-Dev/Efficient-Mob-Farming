# FAQ

### Q: Why Efficient Mob Farming?

A: Efficient Mob Farming was created to fix an issue with some of the existing mob farming mods.
The issue at hand was items being dropped from the farming blocks, which was not optimal for the server. (especially in large farms)

### Q: How is Efficient Mob Farming different from other mob farming mods?

A: Efficient Mob Farming was designed to not drop items from the farming blocks, which is a core feature of the mod.
Other mods used by majority of modpacks do not handle item drops from farming blocks, which can lead to a lot of server lag when dealing with large farms.

Our mod is designed to store the items in a bulk storage, and then transfer them to a targeted destination container wireless and efficiently.

### Q: What was the inspiration behind Efficient Mob Farming?

A: Simple... I was tired of crashing modpack servers due to the amount of items being dropped from other farming mods.
